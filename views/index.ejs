                <p>
                    West Coast Swing (WCS) is one of the &laquo;Street- & Social Dances&raquo; and finds its origin in
                    the
                    Swing-Family.
                    Today WCS is a contemporary dance style. Movements of Hip Hop, Zouk, Jazz, Latin, etc. can be
                    integrated
                    to it. The dance is performed in a long, narrow area (slottet). The dancers usually don't leave this
                    area. The dancers may interpret the music together or independently.The main dynamics is divided
                    into
                    2-stroke units and is mainly formed in 6 - and 8-beat rhythms. These can be varied anytime. On dance
                    events the partners do a permant partner exchange - that means after almost each song.
